//* Aggregation: object A contains objects B; B can live without A.
//* Composition: object A consists of objects B; A manages life cycle of B; B canâ€™t live without A.

  Wrap an existing object into a new Wrapper (the Decorator) which presents the same Interface as the existing / wrapped object,
    but which can extend it as well. Decorators can be chained so as to combined multiple new/added features 
    through composition. 
    
    This pattern allows for "extending" a behavior at runtime.

    Context: A Car manufacturer offers multiple different warranty options to its resellers.
      Those can be combined together to offer a tailored deal.
